= Backup script

== How to install

Put the script under `/usr/local/bin/`. Then modify it to add the paths to backup, and the destination where to save
the backup.

== How to use

Just run `backup`. The script will synchronize the files between the source and the destination (containing the previous
backups). If files are added or modified in the source paths, they will be added or modified in the destination path
too. Likewise, if files have been deleted in the source paths, they will be deleted too in the destination path.
